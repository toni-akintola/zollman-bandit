# Zollman Bandit Model
A bandit model by [Kevin Zollman](https://www.kevinzollman.com/), which depicts how highly connected scientific networks can come to consensus quicker - but may be less accurate than more sparsely connected community.

## Abstract
> Increasingly, epistemologists are becoming interested in social struc-
tures and their effect on epistemic enterprises, but little attention has
been paid to the proper distribution of experimental results among
scientists. This paper will analyze a model first suggested by two
economists, which nicely captures one type of learning situation faced
by scientists. The results of a computer simulation study of this model
provide two interesting conclusions. First, in some contexts, a com-
munity of scientists is, as a whole, more reliable when its members are
less aware of their colleaguesâ€™ experimental results. Second, there is a
robust trade-off between the reliability of a community and the speed
with which it reaches a correct conclusion.
